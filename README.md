Projects for Fun

This repository contains a collection of projects made purely for fun and to validate my understanding of various programming courses I've taken, as well as interesting projects I encounter. Each project is grouped and labeled to allow for better organization and easier exploration of the ideas.

Feel free to explore the code, and I hope you find these projects as enjoyable and educational as I did while creating them!
